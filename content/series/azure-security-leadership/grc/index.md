## Session Abstract

AI, cloud platforms, and automation are moving faster than traditional GRC can keep up. This session shows how to modernize governance so it scales with AI adoption and shifting regulations. Expect practical lessons grounded in real transformation programs across complex, multi-cloud environments.

We will explore how to embed responsible AI governance into existing frameworks, modernize risk management, and use automation and cloud-native controls to improve assurance. You will see how teams operationalize AI risk assessments, build adaptive controls, and coordinate decision-making across security, data, engineering, and business groups.

### Key Takeaways:

- How to refresh GRC frameworks for AI-enabled operations.
- Ways to operationalize AI risk assessments and adaptive controls.
- Where automation and cloud-native controls strengthen assurance.
- How to align cross-functional governance without slowing delivery.
