## Session Abstract

AI systems can fail in ways traditional security testing does not catch. This session explores how red-teaming exposes safety gaps before attackers find them. You will learn how to think like an adversary and turn that mindset into practical testing.

We will cover common AI exploitation patterns, what real-world attacks look like, and how to build a red-teaming program that fits your organization. The session also shows how to integrate AI security testing into existing workflows and maintain ongoing monitoring as models evolve.

### What you'll learn:

- The most common ways AI systems are exploited in practice.
- How to structure red-team exercises for AI safety testing.
- Where to integrate AI security checks in your delivery process.
- How to keep monitoring current as models and threats change.
