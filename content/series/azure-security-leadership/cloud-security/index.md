## Session Abstract

Most cloud breaches do not start on the network. They start higher up in the control plane where identities, APIs, and automation live. This session reframes Zero Trust for Azure management layers so teams can defend the pathways attackers actually target.

We will explore how service principals, federated credentials, access tokens, and pipeline permissions are abused in real environments. You will learn how to set boundaries for management APIs, harden pipeline identities, and use continuous verification in Azure DevOps without slowing delivery.

### Key Takeaways:

- Why the Azure control plane is the highest-value attack surface.
- How to secure Entra ID roles and management API access.
- Where pipeline identities and tokens need stronger guardrails.
- Practical Zero Trust patterns that work in production.
