## Session Abstract

Security cannot be a last-minute gate in modern Azure delivery. This session shows how to build security into the CI/CD flow so risks surface while fixes are still easy. You will see how teams move from manual reviews to automated, developer-friendly guardrails using Azure and GitHub tooling.

We will walk through practical patterns for secret scanning, dependency review, and static analysis inside pipelines, plus Infrastructure-as-Code checks for Terraform to stop risky configurations before deployment. The focus is on pipeline design that keeps velocity high while strengthening security posture.

### What you'll learn:

- Where to place automated security checks without slowing builds.
- How to wire secret scanning, dependency review, and static analysis into pipelines.
- Ways to validate Terraform and policy compliance before provisioning.
- How secure-by-default pipelines support modern DevSecOps practices.
