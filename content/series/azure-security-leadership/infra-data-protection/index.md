## Session Abstract

Enterprise teams need fast, context-aware answers, but data is often scattered across tools and silos. This session dives into Foundry IQ's agentic retrieval engine and how it assembles autonomous knowledge to support decision-making. We will unpack what makes agentic retrieval different from traditional search and where it fits in modern operational workflows.

Expect a focused walkthrough of how the system connects signals, builds context, and surfaces decisions at scale. We will also discuss the considerations teams face when adopting autonomous knowledge systems in real environments.

### Key Takeaways:

- What agentic retrieval is and why it changes enterprise search.
- How Foundry IQ builds context-aware knowledge for decisions.
- Where autonomous knowledge systems fit into enterprise workflows.
- Practical adoption considerations for complex environments.
