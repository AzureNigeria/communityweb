speaker_bio: "I am a Platform and DevOps Engineer working primarily on Azure, with a strong focus on AKS, networking, and security in production environments. My day-to-day work involves designing and operating Kubernetes platforms that handle live traffic, integrate with Azure PaaS services, and meet real security and reliability requirements, and architecting infrastructure. I spend a lot of time dealing with practical challenges such as ingress and egress control, network policies, private endpoints, DNS issues, and observability across Kubernetes and Azure networking. Most of my experience comes from running and troubleshooting these systems in production, where design decisions have clear operational consequences. I enjoy sharing lessons learned from these environments to help other teams build more secure and predictable AKS platforms."

## Session Abstract

Kubernetes is easy to launch, but production security is where the shortcuts surface. Real traffic, layered Azure networking, and operational guardrails quickly expose gaps that the default setup cannot cover. This session brings practical lessons from running AKS in live environments so you can harden security without slowing delivery.

We will trace how traffic moves through ingress, VNets, firewalls, and internal services, then highlight common missteps and how teams corrected them in production. The focus is on pragmatic, repeatable choices that create a sensible security baseline for Azure Kubernetes Service.

### Key Takeaways:

- How inbound, east-west, and outbound traffic flows should be secured on AKS.
- Where teams most often misconfigure network policies and access paths.
- Practical guardrails for ingress, DNS, and private endpoint design.
- A baseline checklist for production-ready Kubernetes network security.
