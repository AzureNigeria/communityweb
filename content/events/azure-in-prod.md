## Session Abstract

Production is where cloud architecture meets reality: traffic spikes, customer expectations, and operational pressure. This Azure in Production session focuses on how teams build reliability and performance without losing agility. Expect practical stories and guidance from Azure engineers who have learned these lessons the hard way.

We will cover what operational excellence looks like day to day, how teams prepare for launches, and which habits keep production environments stable when things change fast.

### What you'll learn:

- How to think about scalability and performance tuning for live Azure workloads.
- The operational signals and practices that prevent small issues from becoming outages.
- Incident response habits that keep teams focused and effective under pressure.
- A readiness mindset for taking Azure apps from staging to real-world demand.
